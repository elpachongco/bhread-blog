The new version of [Bhread](https://bhread.com) is now live!

It took me 4 months to complete this. It took longer than expected because of the holidays and my day job.

We have implemented replies, votes, reposts, and groups. The group feature is not well-implemented and not tested at all, so things will change!

In the future, I plan to implement the per-site comment section feature.
