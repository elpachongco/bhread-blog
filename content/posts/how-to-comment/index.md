To make a comment, you'll need:

1. a blog with an RSS feed.
2. The link of the post you're replying to.

## Step 1: Register your blog to Bhread

1. Go to [bhread.com/feeds](https://bhread.com/feeds/)
2. Paste the link of your blog's RSS feed to the input field and hit submit.

It may take a while (~5 minutes) for Bhread to scan your blog.

Tip: The table lists all RSS feeds registered to Bhread and the time it was last scanned.
Use it to monitor if your blog has been scanned.

## Step 2: Publish a blog post

1. Once your blog has been registered, create a new blog post.
2. Add this text to the beginning of your post: 'replying to '
3. Then add a link to the post you're replying to. For example: 

> replying to [Bhread.com](https://blog.bhread.com)
> 
> Sound check...

By adding `replying to <link here>` to the beginning of any post, 
you're telling Bhread that your post is a reply to the linked post.
This is also a way for your readers to see what post you're replying to.

## Done!

For your next replies or posts you don't need to do step 1 again. All your new
posts will be scanned by Bhread.
