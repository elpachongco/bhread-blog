Before we do more improvements to [Bhread.com](https://bhread.com), we're revamping the Bhread protocol.

## Why do this? 

I realized that replies are not enough to make bhread attractive.
We can do more with our blogs: reposts, groups, tagging, and search.

And so, we need to establish a plan on how to do these things.

What we want is a solid basis for doing things because once it is released 
and adapted by bloggers, it will be very hard to change (big hopes here).

It's also very important to decide plans before heading into development.

The protocol will be an important reference for developers who might want to implement bhread.

## Bhread needs you!

If you're interested, visit the [git repo](http://localhost:1313/posts/about-bhread/) and read
the protocol. It's incomplete as of the moment. Feel free to open an issue or send a message on 
[discord](https://blog.bhread.com/posts/bhread-discord-server/).

As always, any kind of contribution is welcome!
